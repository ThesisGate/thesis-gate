1. What is ThesisGate? A University of Calgary–backed AI platform under Prof. Bin Hu 
(Head of Clinical Neurosciences) that automates detailed thesis review for Master’s, 
PhD, and Honors undergrads—replacing costly expert proofreading with an AI agent 
pipeline. 
2. Why it matters: Students typically pay $100s/hr for experienced PhDs to critique their 
work. ThesisGate delivers comparable depth at a fraction of the cost and turnaround. 
3. How it works, at a glance: 
○ Upload thesis (PDF/DOCX) → chain of specialized AI agents each review 
structure, methodology, citations, and accuracy → multi-stage verification → 
consolidated feedback report. 
4. Who pays & how: 
○ Individual users: One‑flat fee per submission. 
○ Institutional license: University‑wide subscription via Dr. Hu’s department. 
5. Key partnerships: 
○ Prof. Bin Hu (Dept. Head, Clinical Neurosciences, UCalgary). 
○ Society for AI Literacy (SAIL) assisting with outreach, advertising, and AI 
deployment. 
 
1. Background & Context 
Professor Bin Hu leads the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the Cumming School of 
Medicine, University of Calgary. With decades of research in neurolinguistics and clinical AI, Dr. 
Hu secures both academic credibility and institutional buy‑in. His office sponsors ThesisGate, 
guaranteeing initial uptake by UCalgary departments (akin to the campus‑wide scite 
subscription). 
ThesisGate addresses the costly and time‑intensive process of manual thesis review: 
professional academics (often PhDs) charge high hourly rates and have limited bandwidth. Our 
AI‐driven pipeline replaces or supplements this by automating deep-dive critiques. 
Society for AI Literacy (SAIL) partners on marketing, educational workshops, and eventual 
co‑development of the custom AI prompt framework. UCalgary’s enthusiasm for student‑led AI 
projects opens doors for funding and exposure. 
 
2. Platform Overview 

 
1. User Flow: 
○ Sign up / log in (university SSO or email). 
○ Upload thesis draft (PDF/DOCX). 
○ Select service type (individual vs. institutional license). 
○ System validates file & extracts structure. 
○ AI Agent Pipeline executes: 
■ Agent 1: Structure & formatting check. 
■ Agent 2: Methodology & experiment design review. 
■ Agent 3: Citation and literature‐gap analysis. 
■ Agent 4: Data consistency & statistical accuracy. 
■ Agent 5: Language, grammar, and clarity pass. 
○ Multi‑stage verification merges agent outputs, flags conflicts, and escalates 
uncertain sections for human audit. 
○ Receive consolidated feedback report (HTML + PDF) within 24–48 hours. 
2. Key Features: 
○ Automated metadata extraction (title, abstract, chapters). 
○ Custom prompt engine version‑controlled by SAIL & Dr. Hu’s lab. 
○ Revision tracking: compare versions & highlight progress. 
○ Institutional admin dashboard: license‑key usage, departmental analytics. 
○ User rating system to refine AI prompts continuously. 
3. Technical Highlights: 
○ LLM Core: OpenAI GPT‑o3 reasoning model. 
○ Microservices: Upload, Processing (queue & AI calls), Billing, Reporting. 
○ Storage: Encrypted S3 buckets for submissions & reports. 
○ Integrations: Stripe for payments; SAML/OAuth for SSO; PostgreSQL & 
MongoDB for data.
